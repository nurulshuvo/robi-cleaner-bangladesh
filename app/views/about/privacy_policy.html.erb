If there is a conflict between the Digimarka’s Facebook App’s Privacy Policy and Facebook's terms and conditions, guidelines and privacy policies then as between you and us, Digimarka’s Facebook App’s Privacy Policy (this document) will prevail.

2. What information does Digimarka collect?
A. Facebook Data
When you log into a Digimarka App for the first time, it may (depending on the type of App that it is), ask you for permission to access some of your Facebook Profile information for example, it may ask permission to have access to your:
(a) Basic Information (which includes your name, profile pictures, user name, and other information forming your Basic Account Information on Facebook);
(b) Profile Information (including your birthday, groups, hometown, likes, and location etc.); and
(c) your photos.

We call this information, ‘Facebook Data’. This is called Facebook data because this data is supplied by you to Facebook and by Facebook to Digimarka.
If you decide not to grant permission to the relevant Digimarka Facebook App to have access to your Facebook Data, you may not be able to use that Digimarka Facebook  App.
B. Independent Data
During your interaction with our Apps, you may also independently provide us with information about yourself, for example, if you enter a competition or fill out a form through a functionality provided within the App itself.
We call this data ‘Independent Data’ because it is data that you have given to Digimarka through the App. By providing us with this data you acknowledge that it is data that we may use and store in accordance with our privacy policy and any other legal requirements that may apply (for example, if you enter a competition, we need to hold your data to ensure that if you win, we can contact you).
